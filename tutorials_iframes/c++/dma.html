<h1>C++ Dynamic Memory</h1><p>A good understanding of how dynamic memory really works in C++ is essential to becoming a good C++ programmer. Memory in your C++ program is divided into two parts:</p><ul >
<li><p><b>The stack:</b> All variables declared inside the function will take up memory from the stack.</p></li>
<li><p><b>The heap:</b> This is unused memory of the program and can be used to allocate the memory dynamically when program runs.</p></li>
</ul>
