<h1>C - Loops</h1>
    <p>You may encounter situations, when a block of code needs to be executed several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.</p>
    <p>Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.</p>
    <p>A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. Given below is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages âˆ’</p>
    
    <p>C programming language provides the following types of loops to handle looping requirements.</p>
    <table >
<tbody><tr>
<th>S.N.</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Loop Type &amp; Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td><a href="/cprogramming/c_while_loop.htm">while loop</a>
<p>Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td><a href="/cprogramming/c_for_loop.htm">for loop</a>
<p>Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td><a href="/cprogramming/c_do_while_loop.htm">do...while loop</a>
<p>It is more like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td><a href="/cprogramming/c_nested_loops.htm">nested loops</a>
<p>You can use one or more loops inside any other while, for, or do..while loop.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
    <h2>Loop Control Statements</h2>
    <p>Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.</p>
    <table >
<tbody><tr>
<th>S.N.</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Control Statement &amp; Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td><a href="/cprogramming/c_break_statement.htm">break statement</a>
<p>Terminates the <b>loop</b> or <b>switch</b> statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td><a href="/cprogramming/c_continue_statement.htm">continue statement</a>
<p>Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td><a href="/cprogramming/c_goto_statement.htm">goto statement</a>
<p>Transfers control to the labeled statement.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
