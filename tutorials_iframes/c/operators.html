<h1>C - Operators</h1>
    <p>An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical functions. C language is rich in built-in operators and provides the following types of operators −</p>
    <ul >
<li>Arithmetic Operators</li>
<li>Relational Operators</li>
<li>Logical Operators</li>
<li>Bitwise Operators</li>
<li>Assignment Operators</li>
<li>Misc Operators</li>
</ul>
    <h2>Arithmetic Operators</h2>
    <p>The following table shows all the arithmetic operators supported by the C language. Assume variable <b>A</b> holds 10 and variable <b>B</b> holds 20 then −</p>
    <table >
<tbody><tr>
<th style="width:10%">Operator</th>
<th style="width:55%;">Description</th>
<th>Example</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>+</td>
<td>Adds two operands.</td>
<td>A + B = 30</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>−</td>
<td>Subtracts second operand from the first.</td>
<td>A − B = -10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>*</td>
<td>Multiplies both operands.</td>
<td>A * B = 200</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>/</td>
<td>Divides numerator by de-numerator.</td>
<td>B / A = 2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>%</td>
<td>Modulus Operator and remainder of after an integer division.</td>
<td>B % A = 0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>++</td>
<td>Increment operator increases the integer value by one.</td>
<td>A++ = 11</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>--</td>
<td>Decrement operator decreases the integer value by one.</td>
<td>A-- = 9</td>
</tr>

    <h2>Relational Operators</h2>
    <p>The following table shows all the relational operators supported by C. Assume variable <b>A</b> holds 10 and variable <b>B</b> holds 20 then −</p>

<tbody><tr>
<th style="width:10%">Operator</th>
<th style="width:55%;">Description</th>
<th>Example</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>==</td>
<td>Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not. If yes, then the condition becomes true.</td>
<td>(A == B) is not true. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>!=</td>
<td>Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not. If the values are not equal, then the condition becomes true.</td>
<td>(A != B) is true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt;</td>
<td>Checks if the value of left  operand is greater than the value of right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true.</td>
<td>(A &gt; B) is not true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&lt;</td>
<td>Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true.</td>
<td>(A &lt; B) is true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt;=</td>
<td>Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true.</td>
<td>(A &gt;= B) is not true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&lt;=</td>
<td>Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true.</td>
<td>(A &lt;= B) is true.</td>

    <h2>Logical Operators</h2>
    <p>Following table shows all the logical operators supported by C language. Assume variable <b>A</b> holds 1 and variable <b>B</b> holds 0, then −</p>
    <p><a href="/cprogramming/c_logical_operators.htm">Show Examples</a></p>
    <table >
<tbody><tr>
<th style="width:10%">Operator</th>
<th style="width:55%;">Description</th>
<th>Example</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&amp;&amp;</td>
<td>Called Logical AND operator. If both the operands are non-zero, then the condition becomes true.</td>
<td>(A &amp;&amp; B) is false.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>||</td>
<td>Called Logical OR Operator. If any of the two operands is non-zero, then the condition becomes true.</td>
<td>(A || B) is true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>!</td>
<td>Called Logical NOT Operator. It is used to reverse the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true, then Logical NOT operator will make it false.</td>
<td>!(A &amp;&amp; B) is true.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table><h2>Assignment Operators</h2>
    <p>The following table lists the assignment operators supported by the C language −</p>
    <table >
<tbody><tr>
<th style="width:10%">Operator</th>
<th style="width:55%;">Description</th>
<th>Example</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>=</td>
<td>Simple assignment operator. Assigns values from right side operands to left side operand</td>
<td>C = A + B will assign the value of A + B to C</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>+=</td>
<td>Add AND assignment operator. It adds the right operand to the left operand and assign the result to the left operand.</td>
<td>C += A is equivalent to C = C + A</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-=</td>
<td>Subtract AND assignment operator. It subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.</td>
<td>C -= A is equivalent to C = C - A</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>*=</td>
<td>Multiply AND assignment operator. It multiplies the right operand with the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.</td>
<td>C *= A is equivalent to C = C * A</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>/=</td>
<td>Divide AND assignment operator. It divides the left operand with the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.</td>
<td>C /= A is equivalent to C = C / A</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>%=</td>
<td>Modulus AND assignment operator. It takes modulus using two operands and assigns the result to the left operand.</td>
<td>C %= A is equivalent to C = C % A</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&lt;&lt;=</td>
<td>Left shift AND assignment operator.</td>
<td>C &lt;&lt;= 2 is same as  C = C &lt;&lt; 2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt;&gt;=</td>
<td>Right shift AND assignment operator.</td>
<td>C &gt;&gt;= 2 is same as  C = C &gt;&gt; 2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&amp;=</td>
<td>Bitwise AND assignment operator.</td>
<td>C &amp;= 2 is same as  C = C &amp; 2</td>

<tr>
<td>^=</td>
<td>Bitwise exclusive OR and assignment operator.</td>
<td>C ^= 2 is same as  C = C ^ 2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>|=</td>
<td>Bitwise inclusive OR and assignment operator.</td>
<td>C |= 2 is same as  C = C | 2</td>
</tr>
